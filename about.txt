A simple set of code to simulate random 2D motion.
trajectory.png is an output visualizing the trajectories of the simulated particles moving in 2D.
msd.png is an output visualizing the average mean-squared displacement (MSD) of particles plotted
as a function of time. This demonstrates a linear relationship between MSD and time, which is to
be expected for theoretical Brownian particles.
