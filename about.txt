A simple project to simulate random 2D motion.

mySQL_setup.py - Sets up databases for storing the results of the simulations. Required for to
store the results so that they can be accessed to be analyzed and visualized

rw2d.py - collection of code for running, analyzing, and visualizing simulations

trajectory.png is an output visualizing the trajectories of the simulated particles moving in 2D.
msd.png is an output visualizing the average mean-squared displacement (MSD) of particles plotted
as a function of time. This demonstrates a linear relationship between MSD and time, which is to
be expected for theoretical Brownian particles.
